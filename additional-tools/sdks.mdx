## Ditto React SDK
[ditto-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ditto-react) is a library created and maintained by Ditto that makes it easy to pull text from string files managed by Ditto into React applications. It works hand-in-hand with the Ditto CLI to support integrating text, works all CLI JSON formats, and has first-class support for variants.

For instructions on installing and integrating the library into your own codebase, see the [README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ditto-react).

For an example of the Ditto React SDK in action, see the repository for our [React sample project](https://github.com/dittowords/ditto-react-demo). 

## Community SDKs
In addition to `ditto-react`, There are also several SDKs created and maintained by members of the Ditto user community to integrate Ditto with different frontend frameworks.
