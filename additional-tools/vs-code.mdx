title: 'VS Code Extension'
description: 'Extract hardcoded strings into existing Ditto components directly in VS Code'
---

## How does it work? 
Ditto's [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dittotech.vscode-ditto) utilizes the Ditto CLI to aid in the extraction of hardcoded text directly in the [Visual Studio Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can add the extension directly via the VS Code Marketplace. 
This functionality includes: 
- Detecting text in your codebase that matches existing Ditto components
- Automates the insertion of Ditto developer IDs for matching text

The VS Code extension currently works with Ditto React[TODO: Link] components.
