## Setup

You can configure webhooks for your workspace in the **Webhooks** section of your team's [developer integrations](https://app.dittowords.com/account/devtools).

### Signing Key

Prior to creating any webhook endpoints, it's essential to generate and securely store a **signing key**. This key plays a crucial role in appending a signature to all outbound webhook payloads, allowing your server to authenticate that a particular request originates from Ditto.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Signing key requirements">
        Signing keys must be a minimum of 16 characters long. We also recommend that they be randomly generated and stored in a secure environment.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Generating a signing key">
        The **Generate a key for me** button will generate a random signing key and copy it to your clipboard. 

        Alternatively, you can easily generate a random string of characters to serve as a signing key using built-in command line utilities. For example, on most Unix systems, `uuidgen` is available:
        ```
        $ uuidgen
        29D634FF-7831-4468-AA70-0C4997031777
        ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Rotating your signing key">
        When changing your signing key, it’s recommended that you anticipate the key change on your server to avoid missed events.
        
        **Signing key rotation without missed events:**
        1. Generate a new signing key.
        2. Update your webhook server’s code to temporarily accept requests signed with either the old signing key or the new signing key.
        3. Save the new signing key in Ditto.
        4. Update your webhook server’s code to only accept requests using the new signing key.
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

Once you’ve saved your key in Ditto, it is encrypted and cannot be directly accessed. However, you can preview the last four characters of your saved key. 

### Creating a Webhook
You can open the modal for creating webhooks via the **Create Webhook** button.

Each webhook must be assigned **a name, a URL, and have at least one trigger activated**. While there are no strict guidelines for URLs, it is strongly advised that they direct to secure endpoints utilizing HTTPS.

Before saving a webhook, the URL must be validated with a test request. See [Example Webhook Server](https://localhost:3333/additional-tools/webhooks#example-webhook-server) below for details on configuring your webhook server to process a test request.

## Request Headers

Every request sent to a webhook endpoint will have the following three headers included:

- `x-ditto-request-id` — a v4 uuid uniquely identifying a given request. This identifier can be cross-referenced 1:1 with delivery history exported from inside of Ditto.
- `x-ditto-timestamp` — a Unix timestamp identifying the time at which the request was made. This timestamp is included in the signature and can therefore be used to guard against replay attacks.
- `x-ditto-signature` — a signature (HMAC-SHA256) created using your workspace’s webhook signing key, by concatenating the request ID, the timestamp of the request and the request body (each separated by a period).

The JavaScript code below demonstrates how the values for these headers are generated:

```jsx
const crypto = require("crypto");
const uuid = require("uuid");

const requestId = uuid.v4();
const timestamp = new Date().getTime();
const strBody = JSON.stringify(request.body);

const signatureData = `${requestId}.${timestamp}.${strBody}`;
const signature = crypto
  .createHmac("sha256", signingKey)
  .update(signatureData)
  .digest("hex");

const headers = {
	"x-ditto-request-id": requestId,
  "x-ditto-timestamp": timestamp,
  "x-ditto-signature": signature
}
```

## Request Validation

Ditto expects all webhook consumers to return a status code between 200 and 299 to indicate successful payload processing. To enhance your security, it is strongly advised to perform the following actions on your server prior to accepting a webhook payload and issuing a success response:
1. **Validate the signature included in the `x-ditto-signature` header.**
    1. Concatenate the request ID, the timestamp, and a string representation of the request body into a single string, with each component separated by the `.` character
    `${requestId}.${timestamp}.${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`;
    2. Using your signing key, sign the concatenated value using HMAC-256, encoded as hex.
    3. Validate that the signed value you’ve generated matches the value in the `x-ditto-signature` header. If it does not match, then the request is not valid and an error response should be returned.
2. **(Optional) Ensure idempotence by tracking request IDs.**
    1. After validating the signature of a request, track the request ID in a persistent data store (like Redis).
    2. Before processing new requests, check your data store to see if a given request has been seen before; if it has already been processed, then the request is not valid and an error response should be returned.
3. **(Optional) Validate the timestamp included in the `x-ditto-timestamp` header.**
    1. Decide on a time window (e.g. 6 minutes to allow for retries) outside of which you will not accept requests.
    2. Check that the time elapsed since the timestamp in the x-ditto-timestamp header does not exceed your established time window. If it exceeds the time window, then the request is not valid and an error response should be returned.

See [Example Webhook Server](https://localhost:3333/additional-tools/webhooks#example-webhook-server) below for example code for request validation in a Node.js environment.


## Error Handling

If Ditto receives an error response from your server, it will retry sending a payload 3 additional times:
- 1 minute following the initial request
- 2 minutes following the first retry
- 3 minutes following the second retry.

If a given endpoint returns a non-success response for more than 10 requests in a 10 minute window, the webhook will be automatically disabled. If a webhook has been disabled, it can be re-enabled by revalidating with a test request. 

## Event Reference

All request bodies sent to webhook endpoints will have `event` and `data` properties. 

### Component Creation

```tsx
{
  "event": "Component_Creation",
  "data": {
		"componentId": "test_component",

## Example Webhook Server

Here is an annotated code sample showing a simple Node.js server to process webhook events from Ditto:

```tsx server.js

const express = require("express");
const crypto = require("crypto");
const app = express();

// Payloads from Ditto will always be JSON, so ensure your server
// is configured to parse JSON bodies
app.use(express.json());

// The port for the webhook test server to run on
const port = process.env.PORT || 4321;

// This is the key that you've provided
const WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY = process.env.WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY || "xxxxxxx";

// Webhook events will always be sent via POST request
app.post("/", (req, res) => {
  console.log(`--------\nReceived event: '${req.body.event}'`);

  const {
		"x-ditto-request-id": requestId,
		"x-ditto-timestamp": timestamp, 
		"x-ditto-signature": signature
	} = req.headers;

  const threeMinutesAgo = new Date().getTime() - 1000 * 60 * 3;

  // (Optional)
  // Prevent replay attacks by verifying that the timestamp
  // of the webhook is within a reasonable threshold
  if (timestamp < threeMinutesAgo) {
    console.error("❌ Payload is expired");
    return res.status(400).send();
  } else {
    console.log(`✅ Timestamp (${timestamp}) is within past 3 minutes`);
  }

  // Get the input data by concatenating three things, with '.' separating them:
  // - the request id
  // - the timestamp
  // - the stringified request body
  const inputData = `${requestId}.${timestamp}.${JSON.stringify(req.body)}`;

  // Compute a signature using your webhook signing key and the
  // input data
  const computedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", WEBHOOK_SIGNING_KEY)
    .update(inputData)
    .digest("hex");

  // Validate that the payload is from Ditto and hasn't been tampered
  // with by checking that the signature from the header matches your
  // computed signature
  if (signature !== computedSignature) {
    console.error("❌ Invalid signature");
    return res.status(400).send();
  } else {
    console.log(`✅ Signature is valid`);
  }

// (Optional)
// Ensure we never process the same request more than once.
//
// const key = `ditto-webhook_${requestId}`;
// const value = await redis.get(key);
// if (value) {
//   console.error(`❌ Request ${requestId} has already been processed`);
//   return;
// }
//
// await redis.set(key, true, "EX", 0);

  console.log(`Payload: ${JSON.stringify(req.body, null, 2)}`);

	// do something with the payload!

  return res.status(200).send("Received successfully!");
});

app.listen(port, () =>
  console.log(
    `✍️ Ditto webhook test server listening @ http://localhost:${port}`
  )
);
```
