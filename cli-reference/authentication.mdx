## Overview

The Ditto CLI allows developers to access the Ditto API[TODO: Link] directly from the command line. The Ditto CLI  updates text directly in local development. Teams can also build workflows with the CLI, including utilizing it in CI/CD.

## Installation

To install the CLI as a developer dependency:
        
<CodeGroup>
```jsx npm
npm i --save-dev @dittowords/cli
```
```jsx yarn
yarn add --dev @dittowords/cli
```
</CodeGroup>

After installation, you can get a list of the available CLI commands by running the following command inside your project directory:

```
npx @dittowords/cli -h
```

<Info>
**Note:** [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with `npm` 5.2 or higher

## Authentication
The first time you run the CLI, you'll be asked to provide an API key. You can generate an API key in your [developer integrations settings](https://app.dittowords.com/account/devtools).

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Using an env variable for your API key">
    By default, your API key is saved to `$HOME/.config/ditto`; the default path can be overwritten by specifying a custom one via the environment variable `DITTO_CONFIG_FILE`.

    The CLI will not prompt for an API key if a value is provided in your authentication file or in the environment variable `DITTO_API_KEY`.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Updating your API key">
    By default, your API key is saved to `$HOME/.config/ditto`; the default path can be overwritten by specifying a custom one via the environment variable `DITTO_CONFIG_FILE`.

    We don't recommend editing the authentication file by hand; if you need to remove a saved API key or swap one key with another, it's better to fully delete the file and then re-run the CLI.

    To change your API key, delete this file and you'll be prompted for a new key the next time that the CLI executes.

    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Fetching text
Once you've installed, authenticated, and [configured](/cli-reference/configuration) the CLI, you'll be able to pull down up-to-date text by running the CLI:
```
npx @dittowords/cli pull
```
This will update the string files you have locally in the `/ditto` directory from where you're running the CLI. (For more information on the structure of files pulled by Ditto, see [files](/cli-reference/files))

Because the Ditto CLI updates your string files locally, you can continue to manage it as you would with any other product update (push it to staging, commit changes to a branch, etc.).
