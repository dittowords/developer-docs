description: 'Setting what text and formats the CLI pulls down'
---

The `config.yml` file is the source of truth for a given directory about how the CLI should fetch and store data from Ditto. It includes information about which Ditto projects the CLI should pull text from, whether or not the component library should be included, in what format(s) the text should be stored, and more.

This is the default configuration file that is generated the first time that the CLI is run in a given directory:

```yml
sources:
  components:
    enabled: true
format: flat
variants: true
```

### Supported Properties

#### Sources

A list of places the CLI should pull text data from. For the CLI to function, at least one source type (`projects` or `components`) is required.

##### `sources.projects`

A list of projects to pull text from.

```yml
sources:
  projects:
    - id: 61b8d26105f8f400e97fdd14
      name: Landing Page Copy
    - id: 606cb89ac55041013d552f8b
      name: User Settings
```

The `name` property is used for display purposes when referencing a project in the CLI, but does not have to be an exact match with the project name in Ditto.

An `exclude_components` property can be added on a per-project basis to indicate that text items should only be pulled which are not associated with a component:

```yml
sources:
  projects:
    - id: 61b8d26105f8f400e97fdd14
      name: Landing Page Copy
      exclude_components: true
```

##### `sources.components`

A boolean or configuration object indicating how component data should be pulled from your component library.

The simplest configuration is a boolean, which indicates that all components in your component library should be fetched:

```yml
sources:
  components: true
```

You can also pass an object that supports two complementary properties: `root` and `folders`.

- `root` controls behavior for components that are NOT in folders (i.e. that are at the _root_ of the component library)
- `folders` controls behavior for components that are ARE in folders

If `root` is `true` and `folders` is unspecified, **only components not in folders** will be fetched:

```yml
sources:
  components:
    root: true
```

If `root` is `false` and `folders` is unspecified, **only components in any folder** will be fetched:

```yml
sources:
  components:
    root: false
```

If `root` is unspecified and `folders` contains a list of component folders, **only components in the specified folders** will be fetched:

```yml
sources:
  components:
    folders:
      - id: folder-api-id-1
        name: Folder 1
      - id: folder-api-id-2
        name: Folder 2
```

If `root` is `true` and `folders` contains a list of component folders, **non-folder components and components in the specified folders** will be fetched:

```yml
sources:
  components:
    folders:
      - id: folder-api-id-1
        name: Folder 1
      - id: folder-api-id-2
        name: Folder 2
```

`root` can also be specified as a configuration object with a `status` property to indicate that non-folder components should be fetched that have the indicated status:

```yml
sources:
  components:
    root:
      status: WIP
```

#### Variants

Enables including variant information when pulling text data for configured sources.

Defaults to `false` if not specified.

```yml
variants: true
```

#### Format

The format that text data should be generated in. Accepted values:

- `structured`
- `flat`
- `android`
- `ios-strings`
- `ios-stringsdict` (will only include text that has pluralization enabled in Ditto)

Defaults to `flat` if not specified.

```yml
format: flat
```

Also accepts a list of values:

```yml
format:
  - ios-strings
  - ios-stringsdict
```

You should not specify multiple JSON formats in the same configuration, as they will overwrite one another when writing to disk.

#### Status

If specified, only source data with the indicated status will be fetched. Accepted values:

- `NONE`
- `WIP`
- `REVIEW`
- `FINAL`

If `status` is specified at the top level of the configuration, it will apply to all sources:

```yml
status: FINAL
sources:
  components: true
  projects:
    - id: project-1
      name: Project 1
```

`status` can also be specified at the level of individual sources:

```yml
sources:
  components:
    root:
      status: REVIEW
    folders:
      - id: folder-api-id-1
        name: Folder 1
        status: NONE
  projects:
    - id: project-1
      name: Project 1
      status: WIP
```

If both are specified, a source-level `status` overrides a top-level `status`.

More information about Ditto statuses can be found [here](https://www.dittowords.com/docs/tips-for-collaborating).

#### Rich Text

If defined with the `flat` format, output values will be HTML strings (rich text) for each piece of source data.

If defined with the `structured` format, output data will include a `rich_text` property that is an HTML string (rich text) for each piece of source data.

You can read more about Ditto's rich text feature [here](https://www.dittowords.com/docs/rich-text).

```yml
richText: true
```

## CLI Files

### `ditto/` Directory

This directory houses the configuration file (`ditto/config.yml`) used by the CLI and is also the default write destination for any output files the CLI writes to disk.

If you run the CLI in a directory that does not contain a `ditto/` folder, the folder and a default `config.yml` file will be automatically created.

#### Output Files

The CLI outputs data from Ditto by writing files to disk. By default, these files are written to a `./ditto` folder relative to the current working directory, but the location of the output files can be customized by setting the environment variable `DITTO_TEXT_DIR`.

```bash
export DITTO_TEXT_DIR=./src/some-custom-path

# writes output files to ./src/some-custom-path
npx @dittowords/cli
```

The format and extension of such files will correspond to the `format` property of your configuration.

|   **Format**    | **File Extension** |  **Common Usage**   |
| :-------------: | :----------------: | :-----------------: |
|      flat       |       .json        |      Web apps       |
|   structured    |       .json        |      Web apps       |
|       icu       |       .json        |      Web apps       |
|     android     |        .xml        | Native Android apps |
|   ios-strings   |      .strings      |   Native iOS apps   |
| ios-stringsdict |    .stringsdict    |   Native iOS apps   |

All files created will adhere to the following template:

```
{source_name}__{variant_name}.{extension}
```

- `source_name`: the name of the source a given file holds data for
  - for projects, this is `{project-name}`
  - for components, this is `components__{folder_name}`
- `variant_name`: the API ID of a variant or `base` for files generated for non-variant text
- `extension`: the file extension that corresponds to the configured format(s)

To keep cross-platform behavior consistent, file names will be fully lowercase, have whitespace replaced with hyphens, and have non-word characters (with the exception of `-` and `_`) removed.

If the configured format(s) result(s) in JSON files being generated, an `index.js` "driver file" is also created to simplify the process of integrating Ditto into web apps:

```js
module.exports = {
  ditto_component_library: {
    base: require("./components__root__base.json"),
    spanish: require("./components__root__spanish.json"),
  },
  project_xxx: {
    base: require("./example-project__base.json"),
    spanish: require("./example-project__spanish.json"),
  },
};
```

The driver file is currently generated as a CommonJS module, but it's possible that ESM will be supported in the future.

## Authentication

By default, your API key is saved to `$HOME/.config/ditto`; the default path can be overwritten by specifying a custom one via the environment variable `DITTO_CONFIG_FILE`.

To change your API key, delete this file and you'll be prompted for a new key the next time that the CLI executes.
