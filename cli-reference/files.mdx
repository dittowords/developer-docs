## `ditto/` Directory

This directory houses the configuration file (`ditto/config.yml`) used by the CLI and is also the default write destination for any output files the CLI writes to disk.

If you run the CLI in a directory that does not contain a `ditto/` folder, the folder and a default `config.yml` file will be automatically created.

## Output Files

The CLI outputs data from Ditto by writing files to disk. By default, these files are written to a `./ditto` folder relative to the current working directory, but the location of the output files can be customized by setting the environment variable `DITTO_TEXT_DIR`.

```bash
export DITTO_TEXT_DIR=./src/some-custom-path

# writes output files to ./src/some-custom-path
npx @dittowords/cli
```

## String File Naming Convention

All string files created will adhere to the following template:

```
{source_name}__{variant_name}.{extension}
```

- `source_name`: the name of the source a given file holds data for
  - for components, this is `components__{folder_name}`
  - for projects, this is `{project-name}`
- `variant_name`: the API ID of a variant or `base` for files generated for non-variant text
- `extension`: the file extension that corresponds to the configured format(s)

To keep cross-platform behavior consistent, file names will be fully lowercase, have whitespace replaced with hyphens, and have non-word characters (with the exception of `-` and `_`) removed.

## Format-specific Files
If the configured format(s) result(s) in JSON files being generated, an `index.js` "driver file" is also created to simplify the process of integrating Ditto into web apps:

```js
module.exports = {
  ditto_component_library: {
    base: require("./components__root__base.json"),
    spanish: require("./components__root__spanish.json"),
  },
  project_xxx: {
    base: require("./example-project__base.json"),
    spanish: require("./example-project__spanish.json"),
  },
};
```

The driver file is currently generated as a CommonJS module, but it's possible that ESM will be supported in the future.
