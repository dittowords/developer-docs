## How do the example apps work? 
Each Ditto workspace starts off with a sample project (**DittoPay Signup Flow**) covering a simple sign up flow for a banking app, already set up with sample components, variants, variables, and sample usage. 

**To quickly test drive Dittoâ€™s developer integrations, developers can connect the sample project to a frontend using one of our example repos.** 

This is helpful for understanding: 

- How Ditto keeps text in sync from design to development (using our CLI)
- How components in Ditto work (and integrate with a project)
- How Dittoâ€™s developer integrations work for React, iOS, or Android
- How to utilize Ditto variants, plurals, and variable interpolation

Because the example repos come pre-loaded with the sample component's corresponding developer IDs and a configured Ditto CLI, setup should take less than 10 minutes for a full end-to-end integration. ðŸŽ‰
