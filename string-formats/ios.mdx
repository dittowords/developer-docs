## Strings
The `.strings` format is used to surface text in iOS applications. For string plural forms, see the `.stringsdict` format (below).
```swift
"welcome.title" = "Welcome, %1$@!";

/* This should only be used on the logout screen */
"logout" = "Logout";
```
* Ditto Variables are replaced with interpolation placeholders **with a string (@) format specifier**; 
in your client code, you'll need to ensure that all variables passed as arguments are first converted into strings.
* Notes associated with text items will be included as comments above a given key-value pair.
* If this format is exported for a specific variant, two comments containing variant metadata will also be included:
```swift
/* Variant Name: French */
/* Variant Description: Copy localized for native French speakers */

"welcome.title" = "Welcome, %1$@!";
...
```

## StringsDict
The `.stringsdic` format is used to surface plural form text in iOS applications; text without pluralization enabled in Ditto is excluded from output. 
For integrating strings that are not pluralized, you should use `.stringsdict` in conjunction with iOS `.strings`.
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<plist version="1.0">
    <dict>
        <!-- Variables: cartCount, username -->
        <key>cart.header</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSStringLocalizedFormatKey</key>
            <string>%1$#@count@</string>
            <key>count</key>
            <dict>
                <key>NSStringFormatSpecTypeKey</key>
                <string>NSStringPluralRuleType</string>
                <key>NSStringFormatValueTypeKey</key>
                <string>d</string>
                <key>one</key>
                <string>%3$@, you have one item in the cart.</string>
                <key>two</key>
                <string>%3$@, you have a couple of items in the cart.</string>
                <key>other</key>
                <string>%3$@, you have %2$@ items in the cart.</string>
            </dict>
        </dict>
    </dict>
</plist>
```
The order in which variables are provided as arguments in Swift is relevant to the output. The following code could be used with the example output above:
```swift
let localizedString = String.localizedStringWithFormat(
    NSLocalizedString(
        "cart", 
        comment: "A description of the user's cart"
    ),
    // The first argument should always be an integer to determine which plural
    // form to use
    pluralcount, 
    // Subsequent arguments should be provided in alphabetical order according
    // to the names of the Ditto Variables used in a given text item
    String(pluralcount),
    username,
)
```
* A comment structured like `<!-- Variables: variable_one, variable_two, ... -->` is included above each key in the `.stringsdict` file to indicate the order in which variables should be passed (this will always be alphabetical).
* All Ditto Variables are replaced with interpolation placeholders **with a string (@) format specifier** -- in your client code, you'll need to ensure that all variables passed as arguments are first converted into strings.
* If this format is exported for a specific variant, two comments containing variant metadata will also be included:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!-- Variant Name: French -->
<!-- Variant Description: Copy localized for native French speakers -->
<plist version="1.0">
   ...
</plist>
```
